/* Now I´m trying out different variables. Variables are containers that store data.
int - stores integers (whole numbers, no decimals) such as 15 or -10.
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 11,99 or -11,99.
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes ('').
string - stores text, such as "hello world". String values are surrounded by double quotes ("").
bool - stores values with two states: true or false. */
